// Common toodos
// Unify naming conventions. (e.g. always use Abc for enums)
// More Documentations. More meaningful names.
// Add more tooltips.
// Keyboard control.

// How to support "constrained" rule generation? Where does a constraint come from?
// How to support general utf-8 glyphs?
//     Need to check:
//     https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/docs/FONTS.md
// How to build? (Especially, the project should be accessible in linux systems...)
// What is the typical way to include imgui source files in the project?

// What license should this project use?

// Whether to support boundless space? It cannot be too useful without copy/paste...
// Whether to support customized partition? It can get out of control too easily...
// Consider using imgui's "docking" branch?
// Relax dependency to C++17? (X there are already a lot of dependencies...)
// Is it really a good idea to use bool type?
// Are there UBs in the program?

// Refine logs
// Improve layout
// Support tile clipping?

// TODO:
// The program shall fulfill as much as features mentioned in:
