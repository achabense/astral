#### About these files

The rules in "ro4 xx.txt" and "sym xx.txt" were collected in 2021. They were selected from a lot of randomized rules generated by a much simpler program - once upon a time I spent whole days looking through the rules for interesting ones. Actually, these rules were an important motivation for this project. For many years I couldn't forget how I was shocked by the following rule (you can find it in "ro4 b.txt"):

The new rules (those in "rulexx.txt") were collected during the development of this program. Some comments are outdated/confusing as they were referring to some features in the early versions of this program, which may have been removed/renamed/heavily redesigned.

Not all rules are interesting enough in today's standard. However I'd still recommend taking a look at some of them to get familiar with the relevant subsets, and there do exist a lot of amazing rules here and there.

I will recheck and redocument these files finally. There are going to be refined lists of these rules in the future.
