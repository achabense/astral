These documents are interactive. You can left-click the rules (or try the buttons above) to see their effects. Right-click to copy the text (on per-line basis; drag to select multiple lines).

I hope this is impressive enough. It was picked from many randomized rules many years ago ... (... background of this program)

--- The subset
If you have tried the above rule, you may notice that in the left plane, some squares are lighted up with bright-green rings. This means the rule belongs to the "subsets" represented by them. More exactly, the isotropic rule in this example.

The program is based on "subsets" (...)
If you click the "Recognize" button, these subsets are selected automatically...
If you select no subsets, the default one is the universal set (which contains all MAP rules). There is generally no limit what you can do in the universal set.

--- The mask
--- When the subset is very small
--- Randomization
--- Looking through "nearby" rules - the power of "custom mask"

(Suppose you are familiar with the Game-of-Life rule) Well, they look similar to the Game-of-Life rule, with some interesting behaviors.

For the subsets that are "small" enough (for example ...), you may want to "dial" through all of the nearby rules...

Here is a very important tip. Sometimes you may find rules like this:
(from rul33.txt; better example...)

There is no need to stick to the original mask. You can switch to a new mask whenever you find a "better" rule.

--- The "lock" and capture
The following "glider"-ish rule is apparently not found by chance. As you'd expect, there are ways to "reach" to rules like this in this program...

--- When things go wild
Typically you may not hope to get rules that does not belong to any "well-defined" subsets
