    R"(The program is based on several key concepts. They are subset, distance, mask and lock.

------
The "subset" in this program refers to a special type of subsets that can be defined as:
S = empty set or (R, P), where:
1. R is a MAP rule that is designated to belong to S.
2. P is a partition of all "cases".
3. A MAP rule belongs to S iff XOR-masked by R, the masked values are the same in every group in P.

A lot of categories of rules (e.g. isotropic rules / totalistic rules / self-complementary rules etc) can be composed this way. And most importantly, it can be proven that the intersection of such subsets are of the same structure (empty set or (R', P')), so in the program you are free to combine any of the supported subsets as long as the result is not empty.

It's also obvious that any rule in S can equally serve as the defining mask R.

------
If two rules belong to the same subset S = (R, P), then in every group of P their values are either all-same or all-different. As a result, it's natural to define the distance (in subset S) as the number of groups where the two rules have different values.

For example, the following rules have distance = 1 from the Game-of-Life rule in the isotropic subset.

------
A lock is an array associated with a MAP rule, that marks some parts of the rule as contributor for something to happen.

(TODO more explanations...)

You can find a lot of interesting rules without "lock". However, some rules are unlikely discoverable by chance without this feature. Here is an example - an isotropic and self-complementary rule where gliders occur naturally:
MAPARYSZxZtPVoUYRG2cMoGoxdsEtJst5ppcpLka9c/q58GKgMUKdi2sWmmEsm0t8kXOp+s8ZJ3edelQ0mXGbeXfw [/OI4QIQCgACAwBAAAAAQAIAAEMCLAAAAgIAAAAAAAACKAAAAgAKAgAAAAAAAAKAAgACAgAAAAACAAAAAAAAAAA]

The current rule is shown in the right plane. At the top ... (about "sequence"/undo/redo/lock/...)

---- Subset recognition and selection

You may have noticed that in the left plane, some buttons are lighted up with bright-green rings. This means the rule belongs to the subsets represented by them. For example, the Game-of-Life rule is a totalistic rule (which is also isotropic rule). As a result, the second line (which represent native symmetry) and the first button in the third line are lighted up.

If you click the "Recognize" button, the subsets that the current rule belongs to are selected automatically...
Or, you can select the subsets manually to ...

(TODO: "working set"; rename "current" as "working" in edit_rule.cpp)
By selecting these subsets the program is actually performing the intersection of them. The subsets that are bright blue are explicitly selected; the subsets that are marked dull-blue ... The subsets that are marked red ... Feel free to combine the subsets at will to get familiar with their relations.

By default no subsets are selected, which means the universal set (which contains all MAP rules). There is no limit what you can do in the universal set, however, as there is no restrictions the outputs are also unlikely interesting. For example, ...

---- Mask selection

After selecting the subsets you are required to select a mask, which is an arbitrary rule ... based on which you can observe other rules (the current rule) and generate rules based on the mask...

There are four modes that you can select, they are:
1. Zero mask:
....
2. Identity mask:
....
3. Native mask...
Is guaranteed to belong to the [working set]. It is calculated by the program ...
... unless both Zero mask and Identity mask does not work.

....

1. contained.
2. compatible.
3. incompatible.

For universal set ...

---- Rule-generation
There are 3 generation modes that cover most needs. All the 3 modes will skip locked groups, and will do nothing if there are no free groups.

-- Integral mode (<00.. [dec/inc] 11..>)
Treat the free groups as a sequence of 0/1 relative to the mask, and apply integral increment/decrement. With this mode you can iterate through all rules in a subset. It does not matter which mask is used (as long as it's valid) in this case.

Example:
MAPAAAAAQABARcAAQEXARcXfwABARcBFxd/ARcXfxd/f/8AAQEXARcXfwEXF38Xf3//ARcXfxd/f/8Xf3//f////w (whether to add {} lock to ensure the effect?)
This rule belongs to both self-complementary rule and inner-totalistic rule. (whether to explain here?) If you do "Recognize", you wil find both "Zero" and "Identity" mask do not work (... native mask). It's a fairly small subset - only 5 groups exist, which means there are only 2^5 = 32 rules that belongs to the subset.
You can:
1. Select "Native" mask (or custom mask, if the current rule is the above one)
2. "<00.." to set the masked sequence to "0...", which means the result is the same as the masking rule.
3. "inc" until the sequence reached to the end (111...).

-- Permutative mode (<1.0. [prev/next] 0.1.>)
Treat the free groups as a sequence of 0/1 relative to the mask, and reshuffle (?permute) them without changing the distance to the mask. With this mode you can iterate through all rules that have the same distance to the masking rule.

This is especially useful when combining with custom mask. You can check all rules that have distance = 1 to an existing rule.
0. (Correct subset)
1. "Take current" to set the current rule to custom mask. The distance is now 0 (the rule to itself).
2. "inc" to increase the current rule by "1". The distance is now 1.
3. "next"... until the "1" reach to the end. (... About key-binding)

-- Randomization.
Get an arbitrary rule that belongs to the selected subsets, and whose distance to the masking rule (including those that are locked) is exactly / around "C" as set in the program.
(& Zero/Identity mask) ... Again, the masking rule can be the Custom rule ... which means if you have interesting rules you can do randomization with a small distance...

For example, suppose the "Zero" mask belongs to the subset (which is true in most cases), then randomize with dist = ... (effect)

Here is a useful tip: when doing randomize, you can bind the <- -> key to undo/redo and set a larger pace, then you can ...


In a small subset, ...
In a large subset...
Starting from one of Zero or Identity, (or Native if necessary) mask, get randomized rules until you find interesting ones. Then you can try to find nearby rules with permutative mode / randomization with small distance.

In some subsets, sometimes you may find rules like this:
(from rul33.txt; better example...)
MAPA0wFEBBTV2EGZnFywDNkKEYRDigbKHiJ6DIklgrKDhYnSAit2JIckGwBtsuJBFMGAPAc5TPYilLBNImEJIhUoA
However (... -> dist=1)
MAPA0wFEBFTV2EGdnFywDNkKEYRDigbKHiJ6DIklgrKDhYnSAit2JIckGwBtsuJBFMGAPAc5TvYilLBtImEJIhUoA

There is no need to stick to the original mask. You can switch to a new mask whenever you find a "better" rule. This way you are going to "wander" in the , with each important step "fixed" by the identity mask. This turns out to be able to help find a lot of interesting rules.

Each group is shown by one of the cases that belongs to it.

By left-clicking the buttons you flip the values for each case in the group, so the result is actually independent of which mask you have selected / whether there exists locks in the group / or whether the current rule belongs to the subsets or even compatible.

In any case (whether !compatible or !contained), you will switch back if you click on the same button twice.
