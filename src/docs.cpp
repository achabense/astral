To begin with, it's necessary to explain some key concepts in this program. They are subset, mask and lock.

(Not an arbitary subset of the MAP rules) A "subset" S (if not empty) is composed of:
1. A MAP rule R that is designated to belong to S.
2. A partition P of all "situations".
Then, a MAP rule belongs to the subset iff XOR-masked by R, the masked values are the same in every group in P.

The commonly recognized rules (e.g. isotropic rules / totalistic rules) can be defined as such subsets. And most importantly, it can be proven that the intersection of such "subsets" are of the same structure, so in the program you are free to combine (essentially ...) any of the supported subsets as long as the result is not empty. (And the "mask" concept apply to the combined subsets). ... explain gui...

A mask is any rule that belongs to the subset. Especially, R serves as a mask.
This looks like a trivial definition, however, as you will see, (combined with "distance") this concept is powerful to help find interesting rules...

A lock is ... You can find a lot of interesting rules without this feature, however ...
Here is an example that are unlikely to be available without this feature...
An isotropic and self-complementary rule where gliders occur naturally:

(Gui part)
--- The subset
You may have noticed that in the left plane, some squares are lighted up with bright-green rings. This means the rule belongs to the "subsets" represented by them. More exactly ...

If you click the "Recognize" button, these subsets are selected automatically...
If you select no subsets, the default one is the universal set (which contains all MAP rules). There is generally no limit what you can do in the universal set. By selecting more subsets ...

--- The mask
--- When the subset is very small
--- Randomization
--- Looking through "nearby" rules - the power of "custom mask"

It's easy to define the "distance" between two rules if they belong to the same subset - the distance can be defined as the number of groups that have different values.
Below are some interesting rules that are very "close" to the Game-of-Life rule (actually, distance = 1 in the "isotropic" subset).

Here is a very important tip. Sometimes you may find rules like this:
