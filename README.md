(Mess)
The program (later called editor) is intended to be used ?v assistance ?prep a (arbitrary) text editor.

Grouping: If a rule is ?? it satisfies the concept behind the partition...
Predefined groups:
Native ...
Hex...
...

About state symmetry(?)

Lock: Together with the ??? rule, a lock is a representation of what can happen / has happened ...

Evolvement capture:
It ... leave enough space for the ...
(TODO: Detect invalid capture...)
Still-life constraints: ...

(TODO: program-specific data (lock-?partition...))

#### About this program
* This program enables easy ways to recognize and operate on ... which are representable with ??? (need explanation)

#### What can be saved & how to save
* Rules can be loaded and exported via MAP format strings. The program is unable to recognize rules in other formats. To compensate for this ...
* Click "Copy" to save to the clipboard. (Where to store the string is up to the users.)
* The program is able to load multiple rules from files or the clipboard. Click "Paste" to load from the clipboard. There are no specific requirements for the file format - the program just treats ??? as byte streams and extracts every sequences recognizable as MAP strings.
* Paths of the files can be provided as ???, or the program is able to select the paths via a ???

#### Use cases
~ Randomization
(mask: zero vs identity)

~ Iterating through all rules under von Neumann neighborhood
... (add spatial symmetry) ...(mis-combination (that makes into a whole group))

~ Dialing through Game of Life rules in the iso subset...
(show some of the interesting rules)
(randomization based on custom mask(==gol))

~ Capture the glider
(show the glider-only rule)
(wrong way of capturing (e.g. for oscillators, bounding-box is not enough))

#### Dependency
* ImGui
* SDL2
