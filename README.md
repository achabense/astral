### Astral
This program is designed for exploring 2-state CA rules in the range-1 Moore neighborhood (aka ["MAP rules"](https://golly.sourceforge.io/Help/Algorithms/QuickLife.html#map)).

#### Features
- Rules are saved as MAP-strings, so you are able to test them in other programs like Golly. Also, patterns can be saved as RLE-strings.
- Subset-based rule analysis and edition. The supported subsets include isotropic/totalistic rules in Moore/hexagonal/von-Neumann neighborhood, self-complementary rules and so on. You can combine multiple subsets to explore rules in the intersection of them (for example, self-complementary isotropic rules).
    - Rule-analysis: the program is able to tell whether a MAP-rule is isotropic/self-complementary etc.
    - Rule-edition: the program is able to generate (theoretically all possible) rules in any supported subsets.
- Preview mode, making it easier to "know" which direction to edit for for more interesting rules.
- The program is able to load lists of MAP rules from files or the clipboard. There are a lot of rules available in `rules/...`.
- "Lock & capture" - the program is able to extract value constraints from patterns and generate rules under the constraints (for example, rules allowing for gliders).

#### Getting started
In the program: press 'H' to learn about basic operations; check every tooltip; check the "Documents" (in the program) to get familiar with the concepts and workflow.

As a starting point, here is how to save rules/patterns:
- Saving/undoing rules: right-click the MAP-string to save the current rule to the clipboard; use the widgets right above the MAP-string for undoing/redoing.
- Saving patterns: right-click to select area and press 'C' to save the pattern to the clipboard (as RLE-string).

#### Dependencies & Building
- The project uses CMake for building. The program is written in C++20 using [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) libraries. (ImGui is copied in this project; SDL2 will be fetched automatically by CMake.) In my experience, the project can be opened and built directly in Visual Studio (CMake tools required).
- As to OS dependency: the project is developed on Windows 10, but hopefully also works on other systems (rebuilding needed).

#### Recent plans
- Cleanups for rule lists (those in `rules/...`). There are going to be refined lists of rules in the formal releases.
- Refine visual/layout.
- Add support for unbounded space.
- Refine and stabilize keyboard/mouse controls etc. Some controls may be different in the formal release.
- (Maybe) Add a convenient way to save rules directly into files.
- (Maybe) Add support for icons/fonts.
- (Maybe) Make some controls/default settings user-customizable.
